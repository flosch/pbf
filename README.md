OpenStreetMap PBF golang parser

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/maguro/pbf.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/maguro/pbf)

Yet another OpenStreetMap PBF parser whose implementation is heavily influenced
by the golang project [github.com/qedus/osmpbf](https://github.com/qedus/osmpbf).
It's one of the projects being used to familiarize myself with golang.
